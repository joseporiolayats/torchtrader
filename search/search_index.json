Introduction This document presents the architecture design for the Torch Trader platform, a next-generation trading solution that supports stocks and cryptocurrencies. Torch Trader aims to provide a comprehensive, high-performance, and user-friendly trading environment by leveraging advanced analytics, backtesting, deep learning, and trading bot automation. This architecture design outlines the key components, their interactions, and the overall structure of the platform. 2. System Overview The Torch Trader platform comprises the following major components: Data Collection and Storage Technical Analysis and Scripting Backtesting Engine Strategy Optimization and Deep Learning Trading Bots and Monitoring User Interface Support and Maintenance These components work together to provide a seamless and powerful trading experience for users. The architecture design aims to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability, facilitating future enhancements and growth. 3. Component Architecture 3.1 Data Collection and Storage The data collection and storage component is responsible for gathering stock and crypto market data from various sources and storing it efficiently. This component includes: Data Collection : Integrating popular APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, and Binance to gather market data. Data Storage : Storing collected data in a structured format, such as CSV files or a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL. 3.2 Technical Analysis and Scripting The technical analysis and scripting component enables users to apply built-in indicators and create custom trading strategies. This component includes: Technical Analysis : Providing a library of built-in technical indicators using TA-Lib or Tulipy. Scripting Engine : Allowing users to create, edit, and manage custom trading strategies using Python scripts. 3.3 Backtesting Engine The backtesting engine simulates trading with historical data and evaluates the performance of user-defined strategies. This component includes: Backtesting : Implementing a robust backtesting engine using libraries like Backtrader, PyAlgoTrade, or Zipline. Performance Metrics : Providing comprehensive performance metrics, trade logs, and visualizations of backtesting results. 3.4 Strategy Optimization and Deep Learning The strategy optimization and deep learning component leverages advanced techniques to optimize trading strategies. This component includes: Deep Learning : Implementing deep learning models using PyTorch for strategy optimization. CUDA Support : Enabling GPU acceleration with CUDA for high-performance model training. Optimization Algorithms : Applying optimization algorithms like grid search or Bayesian optimization to fine-tune strategies. 3.5 Trading Bots and Monitoring The trading bots and monitoring component automates trading and tracks the performance of user-defined strategies. This component includes: Trading Bots : Developing trading bots capable of executing trades on popular stock and crypto exchanges using their APIs. Monitoring System : Implementing a monitoring system to track bot performance, including profit/loss, trade history, and strategy performance.

It was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his 1978 book \"New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\". The RSI is a momentum oscillator that ranges between 0 and 100 and is primarily used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a security. Overview The RSI calculates the ratio of the average price gains to the average price losses over a specified period, usually 14 days. The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100, with readings above 70 generally considered overbought and readings below 30 considered oversold. graph LR A[Price Gains and Losses] --> B[Compute Average Gain and Loss] B --> C[Compute RS] C --> D[Compute RSI] Implementation Our implementation uses PyTorch to compute the RSI indicator. The code defines a class called RSI that inherits from the nn.Module class. The RSI class has a forward method that takes two arguments: window_size and prices . Main Steps Compute the individual gains and losses for each price change. Calculate the average gain and loss using a moving average with the specified window size. Compute the Relative Strength (RS) as the ratio of the average gain to the average loss. Calculate the RSI using the RS value. Code Structure The RSI class has the following methods: __init__ : Initializes the RSI class and sets the window_size attribute to None . forward : Takes prices and window_size as input arguments, sets the window_size attribute, and computes the RSI. compute_individual_gains_losses : Takes gains_losses as input and returns the individual gains and losses. compute_avg_gain_loss : Takes gains and losses as input and returns the average gain and loss. compute_rs : Takes avg_gain and avg_loss as input and returns the Relative Strength (RS). compute_rsi : Takes rs as input and returns the RSI value. Example Usage import torch from torch.jit import script from torchtrader.ta.rsi import RSI # Set the seed torch . manual_seed ( 42 ) # Generate random test prices prices = torch . randn ( 100 ) # Prepare the RSI class for TorchScript scripted_rsi_calculator = script ( RSI ()) window_size = 14 scripted_rsi = scripted_rsi_calculator ( prices , window_size ) print ( scripted_rsi ) This example demonstrates how to use the RSI class with TorchScript to compute the RSI indicator for a sequence of 100 random prices.
