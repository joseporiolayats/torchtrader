## **7. Test Strategy**

The test strategy encompasses several testing levels, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. The testing process will involve both manual and automated testing techniques to ensure comprehensive coverage and efficient defect detection.


### **7.1 Unit Testing**



* **Objective**: Validate the correctness and reliability of individual components and functions.
* **Approach:** Perform functional and boundary testing on individual functions and modules.
* **Tools**: Pytest, unittest, or other Python-based testing frameworks.
* **Deliverables**: Test cases, test scripts, and test results.

###
    **7.2 Integration Testing**

* **Objective**: Verify the interaction and integration of various components and modules within the platform.
* **Approach**: Perform interface, communication, and data flow testing between the different components and modules.
* **Tools**: Pytest, unittest, or other Python-based testing frameworks.
* **Deliverables**: Test cases, test scripts, and test results.

###
    **7.3 System Testing**

* **Objective**: Assess the platform's performance, reliability, and stability as a whole.
* **Approach**: Perform load testing, stress testing, and endurance testing to evaluate the platform's performance under various conditions.
* **Tools**: JMeter, Locust, or other performance testing tools.
* **Deliverables**: Test cases, test scripts, and test results.

###
    **7.4 User Acceptance Testing**

* **Objective**: Validate the platform's usability, accessibility, and responsiveness for end-users.
* **Approach**: Perform usability testing, accessibility testing, and compatibility testing with different browsers, operating systems, and devices.

##
    **8. Test Metrics and Evaluation**


The test metrics and evaluation criteria will be used to assess the quality and success of the testing process. Key metrics include:



1. Test Coverage: The percentage of functional requirements and design specifications covered by test cases.
2. Defect Density: The number of defects identified per unit of code or functionality.
3. Defect Removal Efficiency: The ratio of defects detected during testing to the total number of defects found.
4. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): The average time between system failures during system testing.
5. Test Execution Time: The total time taken to execute all test cases.

The test results will be compared against the established quality objectives and requirements to determine the overall success of the testing process and the readiness of the platform for deployment.
